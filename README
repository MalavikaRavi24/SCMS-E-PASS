INTRODUCTION
SCMS E-PASS is a web-based platform designed for hostel students to conveniently book weekend transportation. The system features two portals—Student and Admin—ensuring seamless access and management. Students can register, log in, and search for buses by entering the origin, destination, and travel date. The platform instantly calculates travel expenses, allowing users to make informed decisions. Seat allocation follows a real-time, First-In-First-Out (FIFO) method to ensure fairness and efficiency. After selecting a preferred seat, students can proceed with a secure UPI payment. Upon successful payment, users receive a downloadable QR code and a digital ticket containing all relevant travel details for easy access. The Admin portal facilitates smooth backend operations, enabling efficient monitoring and management of bookings. SCMS E-PASS enhances transparency, reduces manual workload, and ensures a streamlined booking experience through automation and digital payment integration, making it a smart and scalable solution for hostel transport management.
